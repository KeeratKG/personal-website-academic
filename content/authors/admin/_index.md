Iâ€™m an engineering undergraduate student enthusiastic about Interdisciplinary and Applied Research involving Data.  I am keen on a career wherein I can use my tech skills for social good and create an impact in the world around me. I try to strike a balance in everything I do, including my work and personal life :)

**Currently, I am interning at the Machine Learning Lab, University of Freiburg with Dr Frank Hutter as a DAAD WISE Scholar.**

As a person, I'm chirpy- I adore striking conversations with new people and knowing more about them. I am a passionate debater and represent my University at various levels. I'm involved in the campus journalistic activites and also love playing Badminton. I do well in diverse team-based environments and prize effective communication in my approach.

Feel free to connect!
