Iâ€™m a recent graduate of IIT Roorkee, enthusiastic about Interdisciplinary and Applied Machine Learning Research.  In the past, I have enjoyed working on designing computational solutions for problems in healthcare. I aim to create positive impact through my work, and try to strike a balance in everything I do :)

**I started my MS in Applied Computing at the Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto from Fall 2022.**

As a person, I'm chirpy- I adore striking conversations with new people and knowing more about them. I like to keep my hobbies versatile, from parliamentary debating to painting to badminton. I do well in diverse team-based environments and prize effective communication in my approach.

Feel free to connect!
